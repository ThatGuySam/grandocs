		<h1>General Safety Instructions</h1>


		<p>Read all the instructions in the user’s manual, especially the safety requirements see <a href="/Topic/7f5753dc-bbe6-4fd5-8bac-29417347a6ff">Safety requirements</a></p>

<p>Follow all instructions. Keep the user’s manual for later use.</p>

<p>Follow all cautions and warnings indicated on the unit.</p>

<p>Disconnect the mains plug before cleaning the unit; don’t use any liquid or spray cleanser. Clean with a dry cloth.</p>

<p>Do not use the unit near water. Do not expose it to a humid environment. Do not spill any liquid over the unit.</p>

<p>Unplug this apparatus during lightning storms or when unused for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Do not block or cover any ventilation slots in the housing - they guarantee the reliable functioning of the unit and protect it against overheating. Do not install the unit into a frame unless sufficient ventilation is guaranteed. Install in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>Do not insert any objects through the slots of the unit, as these could get in contact with live parts or could cause short circuits. This may cause a fire and an electric shock.</p>

<p>Do not place the unit on unstable surfaces. It may fall and get damaged.</p>

<p>Do not place any objects on the power cord. Protect it from being walked on or pinched particularly at plugs and the point where they exit from the apparatus.</p>

<p>If using an extension cord, make sure the rated output of all units connected in aggregate does not exceed the maximum rated output of the extension cord. The rated output of the units plugged into the socket should in aggregate not exceed 10 amperes.</p>

<p><strong>If the power cord or the mains plug is damaged, let a qualified technician replace it immediately.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Only use power cords which are marked as safety-proof.</strong></p>

<p><strong>All service work should be exclusively performed by qualified service technicians.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do not use any high-power walkie-talkies or cellular phones near the unit.</strong></p>

<p>The unit is provided with a safety plug. This plug can only be used with safety sockets. These precautions should by all means be followed. If the plug should not fit into a given socket (e.g. the case with old sockets), the socket should be replaced by an electrician.</p>

<p>Do not ignore the safety purpose of the grounding-type plug. A grounding type plug has two blades and a third grounding prong. The third prong is provided for your safety. If the provided plug does not fit into your outlet, consult an electrician for replacement of the obsolete outlet.</p>

<p>As with all industrially manufactured goods, the use of substances that induce an allergic reaction such as aluminium cannot be generally excluded. If you develop an allergic reaction (such as a skin rash, frequent sneezing, red eyes or respiratory difficulties), consult a physician immediately to determine the cause.</p>

<p>Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel. Servicing is required when the apparatus has been damaged in any way, such as power-supply cord or plug is damaged, liquid has been spilled or objects have fallen into the apparatus, the apparatus has been exposed to rain or moisture, does not operate normally, or has been dropped. Besides others, you run the risk of suffering an electric shock.</p>

<p><strong>If one of the following conditions occurs, please disconnect the mains plug and call your dealer or technical support!</strong></p>

<p>Power cord or mains plug is damaged or worn.</p>

<p>Liquid penetrated the unit.</p>

<p>The unit was exposed to rain or high ambient humidity.</p>

<p><strong>The unit does not function properly, even when following all the instructions in the manual. Only manipulate the controls as stated in the manual, wrong settings on the controls may damage the unit.</strong></p>

<p>The unit fell and the housing was damaged.</p>

<p>WARNING: TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE OR ELECTRIC SHOCK, DO NOT EXPOSE THIS APPARATUS TO RAIN OR MOISTURE</p>
